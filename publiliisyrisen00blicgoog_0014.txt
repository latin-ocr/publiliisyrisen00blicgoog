l. THE AUTHOR'S NAME.

Urrrrn the beginning of the sixteenth century the ‘sentences' ir* s ³
· were attributed to the philosopher Seneca, from whose credit ¹.

to that ol Publilius they were transferred by Desiderius
Erasmus. It was, moreover‚ only quite recently at the hands

of Sillig the editor of Pliny, that the name of Publilius
was substituted for the monstrosum nomen (so E Woelfflin calls

it) of Publius, although the latter form was preserved in manu-
scripts of Cicero, the Senecas, Gelhus, Macrobius and Jerome.
Woelfflin, supported by Ritschl, definitely established the
name Publilius, which has been accepted by such authorities

as Baehr and Teuffel.

Pliny in his Natural History (35, 5199) says: ‘Publilium
Iochium mimicae scaenae conditorem et astrologiae conso-
brinum eius Manilium Antiochum, item grammaticae Staberium
Erotem eadem nave advectos videre proavi,' which appears to
give Publilius the second name of Lochius, and both Ο. Jahn
and Woelfflin have conjectured that the name should be
Antiocbium, which seems not unhkely, as we find his cousin
called Antiochus. Woelfflin points outa similar error in the
Medicean rrs. os Tacitus (13. 7) where iochum is found for
Antiochum. This of course agrees very well with the cog-
nomen of Syrus, which is usually given him, probably out os
Macrobius.
