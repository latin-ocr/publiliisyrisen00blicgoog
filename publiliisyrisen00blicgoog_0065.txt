R0÷15, so÷42‚ T 0÷3, V0÷24, i.e. altogether
265 ÷ 385 or an aggregate of 650, besides 61 sentences
(separately) from codd. T. and M. Spengel rejects
the prose sentences and treats genuineness from a new
point of view, and while he has been happy in his
emendations of several verses, he has condemned all
the verses of collection Z and many of collection Φ,
‘pudet dicere me in hoc libello nihil addidisse eius’ (ie
Woelfflinii) ‘diligentiae nisi quod codicem Frisingensem

ἱ (F), qui liber alteram partem sententiarum solus con·
tinet, et apographo a patre meo dudum sacto et ipso
codice usus denuo contuli.’ Whereas the efforts of
Woelfflin and Meyer were directed to obtaining the
most anthentic text, Spengel attempted to find an
intelligible one, and while most editors have erred in
the direction os sticking too closely to a Phaedrus
model, especially in questions osmetre, Spengel (perhaps
not unnaturally) has been rather too Plautinist.*

Spmchverse des Publilius Syrus'3 not nominally an
edition, but as many new sentences are given and the
question of genuineness is scientifically discussed, it is of
immense value and importance.
