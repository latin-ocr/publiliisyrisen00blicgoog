work. To replace any lack on this account l have
however consulted nearly a hundred editions ol my
author.

Although, from the advances made in textual
criticism and general classica} research since Bentley's
day, this edition ought to be in sire and accuracy
superior to any of its compatriots, it does not presume

to enter the lists with modern German editions. Most
frequently l follow Meyer, though sometimes preferring

the lead ol Woelfflin, Spengel or Friedrich, while I have
occasionally ventured to differ from all of them and
either to hark back to some older authority or in a very
few cases to make a suggestion os my ownÍ¾ but the

only merit l might lay claim to, is comparison must be
made with these Teutonic giants, is that of giving a
rather more orderly account ol the manuscripts and

editions. The collecting of information on these heads
has been a most delightlul recreation.

1 may be charged perhaps with lack of scholarliness
in giving English surroundings to Publilius lor the
Germans are charitable enough to their neighbours to
write their prolegomena and notes in Latin. In this I
have been guided mainly by the prevailing custom in
this country, and further by the hope that some will be
tempted to gain an introduction to my author who
might have been srightened away by a Latin setting.
