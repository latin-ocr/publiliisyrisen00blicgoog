cum lascivia imitati03 a Graecis ita definitus: μῖμός ἐστι
μίμησις βίου τά τε σηκεχωρημένα καὶ ἅσνγχῶρηῐα περιέχων)
Evanthius says the mimes were so named ‘ab diuturna
imitatione vilium rerum et levium personarum,' while Isidore
says ‘mimi sunt dicti graeca appellatione quod rerum
humanarum sint imitationes! Plutarch says that neither the
ὑποθέσεις nor the παίγνια (two kinds of mime) were fit for
representation at dinner, the former being too long for such a

quotations which prove the identity of the planipes and the
mimus, though possibly the former may have been the earlier

and Lentulus, besides whom we hear also οἰ Hostilius,
Marullus, Atticus, Vergilius Romanus, Aemilius Severianus
and Aesopus. Our information about the character os the
mimi os this period enables us to draw conclusions as to the
original character os the whole species, making allowance
for the over-refined character os a later time, and keeping in

‚ mind that aster the absorption os all other kinds os drama in

the mimus,a more varied action was developed in it and it

anived at greater independence.'
As a good laugh was the chief aim of the mime all through

its career, the actors (there were several in the middle period
and many in later times) wore harlequin's jackets, indulged in
comic gesticulation, made faces, imitated the sounds of birds
and beasts and played the sool generally. The actresses,
