mimae, some of whom became notorious or perhaps hmous
(the word archimima occurs in inscriptions), in so far as they
were dressed at all, were dressed gaily, their chief spedality
being the ricinium, a sort of small shawl or mantilla.
Originally masks were not worn, though it seems that after·
wards a small mask covering only a small part ol the cheeks
was sometimes used In Rich's Dr'ctrbwary os Roman and
Greek Antiquitas (p. 4² 5) there is a drawing ol the mimic
mask, from an engraved ring. Dancing aud singing were at
some period partos the performance

The names even of the plays ol Publilius are unknown to
us, except that we have in Nonius ‘Publilii Putatoribus’ and
in Priscian ‘Publius in Murmidone.' The titles of mimes
generally are such as one would expect from their character,
Aquae caldae, Augur, Compitalia, Fullo and Virgo are names
common to mimes and togatae, while Gemini, Hetaera,
Nuptiae and Piscator (as well as Fullo and Virgo) are shared

by mimes and Atellanae. ‘With the palliata,' Teuffel says,
‘the mimus shares the titles Colax, Hetaera and Phasma, and
. besides we find the following originally Greek titles of mimi:
Alexandrea, Belonistria, Cophinus, Ephebus, Necyomantia and
SCYI‘Pbe language ol the mimes was plebeian, not to say

vulgar 3 and the lun was brought only into stronger relies by
the wise saws with which some of them, those os Publilius at
any rate, were interlarded

The chief metres used were iambic senarii and trochaic
tetrameters, though the choliambic metre occurs, and probably
a good deal ol the play was sermo pedestris.
