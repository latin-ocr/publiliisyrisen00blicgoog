there being indeed in some casesa mere change in the order
of the words.

Tne use of the sentences in the first three centuries alter
their editio princeps had appeared was somewhat similar to
their use in Roman days, but they were ruthlessly ‘borrowed'
by Despreaux, La Fontaine, Racine, Rollin, Voltaire and even
Moliere, while La Bruyere appropriated nearly all the
sentences. The last-named also rang the changes on a good
many verses in a style not so very unlike the way in which
Roman boys had probably been taught to vary them.

VI. THE MANUSCRIPTS.

The uss, like the Sentences themselves, have had a
chequered existence Before the ninth century the second
half (from Ο onwards) disappeared ; the remainder, with a
jumble of prose sentences from PseudoSeneca de Moribus
(a collection, as Teuffel supposes, then more complete than
now) pressed into verse in Procrustean fashion‚ received
the title os Proverbia Senecae, and in the course of time,
especially during the 14th and 15th centuries, received inter-
polations from other writers. Meanwhile in the roth century
the second half os the sentences had re·appeared 3 the scribe
of F in the rrth century used it, inserting its verses after the
prose sentences under each letter, thus the Σ and 11 groups,
from the same archetype, were blended again in Ψ. W. Meyer
in ‘Die Sammlungen der Spruchverse des Publilius Syrus’
(Leipzig, 1877) goes very fully into the question of the several
uss. and the groups into which they should be arranged.
The following list is intended to show the net results of his
investigations together with those of Woelfflin and Friedrich.
