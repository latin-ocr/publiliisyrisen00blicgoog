INTRODUCTION.

Salvianus, De Gub. Dei, 1, 10:
“Ut ille ait:
‘Aliena nobis, nostra plus aliis placent.'”

Ribbeck also mentions passages from Priscian, Nonius and
Isidore which are supposed to contain allusions to Publilius.

IV. THE MIME.

The history of the Mime is divided naturally into two
periods, the first coinciding roughly with the existence of the

Republic during which time it was undergoing the processes of ·

development and played no part in literature. In its earliest
days it was probably mere extempore fun at the expense of
the bystanders‚ and one of its chief weapons was the imitation
of personal peculiarities; indeed mimicry remained to the end
its distinctive feature, and in its palmy days it dared to ‘take
off ' quite exalted personages. While a mere street perform·

ance, its length depended obviously on the patience of its
chance audience and the endurance and wit of its one
performe13 after this it may have stood forth on the stage on
its own merits, though this has not yet been distinctly proved 3
later on, as Teuffel says¹‚ ‘when personnances os a serious
nature had gained the ascendancy‚ they were employed as

alter-plays, though for a long time they were less popular than
the newly accepted Atellanic farces' Teuffel has brought
together a very complete collection of contemporary evidence
as well as a list of modern authorities conceming mimeS,
though we have still much cause to regret that no mime has
come down to us. However‚ as far as the general object of
the mime is concerned‚ the definitions we have leave us little
room for doubt. Diomedes says ‘Mimus est sermonis cuius·
libet motus sine reverentia, vel factorum et (etiam) turpium
